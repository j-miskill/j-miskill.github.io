  <h1>Jackson Miskill's Website</h1>

  <p>
    This is a sink for all of my thoughts, ideas, and general whatevers. I love
    writing, so I created this page for me to be able to write about what I want
    to write about, without serving 1000 ads at the same time. Being a CS major,
    I thought it would be fitting for me to code up my own website. WordPress
    does not allow you to do this- it serves those to read the content about
    1000 ads and it's just janky (professional term). Here are some of the
    things I will be writing about:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Computer Science</li>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
    <li>Data Science</li>
    <li>Inspirations</li>
    <li>Fly Fishing</li>
    <li>Things going on in my life</li>
    <li>Things I find super neat and the world should too</li>
    <li>Life - living honestly and slowly</li>
  </ul>
