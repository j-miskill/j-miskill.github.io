# Hi, I'm Jackson!

## Who I Am
I am a fourth year at the University of Virginia studying computer science for my undergraduate and graduate degrees. 

### My Interests 
I am interested in creating software for the public good; when I land a job, I want to use that job to promote the public welfare and create better lives for those around the world. I believe that technology can be the answer to that. 

Artificial intelligence, cloud computing, system building, and cyber-physical systems are the areas that I find the most interesting.

In addition to all of the computer science, I am double majoring in cognitive science. I find the study of the brain to be intrinsically very interesting. Lately, I have been reading and thinking about problem solving, flow, and stoicism. 

### Why Did I Create This Website

WordPress sucks for free writing. I am not a professional looking to make money by writing crap all the time. I am looking for a place to be creative an express myself.
