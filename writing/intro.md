# Hi, I'm Jackson!

## Who I Am
I am a fourth year at the University of Virginia studying computer science for my undergraduate and graduate degrees. 

### My Interests 
I am interested in creating software for the public good; when I land a job, I want to use that job to promote the public welfare and create better lives for those around the world. I believe that technology can be the answer to that. 

Artificial intelligence, cloud computing, system building, and cyber-physical systems are the areas that I find the most interesting.

In addition to all of the computer science, I am double majoring in cognitive science. I find the study of the brain to be intrinsically very interesting. Lately, I have been reading and thinking about problem solving, flow, and stoicism. 

### This Website

This website has two main tab above. The "Projects" tab will take you to a list of current and past projects that I am undertaking or have undertaken. I also have ideas for many more projects, but I am keeping that locally currently. The second tab, "Writing" will take you to a page that has all of my writing that I have done. That page use to exist on a Wordpress page, however, being a computer science student (and finding Wordpress to be quite annoying), I decided to build my own page to hash this out. I will continue to contribute writing to this (and I want to build a program that will monitor scrape the website for changes and send an email to those who I think should know when I post a new post on the blog). 

### Maintenance

I will be maintaining this website on my own. I am hoping to not get too bogged down in work. After building this initial layout, I realized that much of this could be automated ... 

good thing I'm a CS student. 


### Contact

I can be reached at [jcm4bsq@virginia.edu](jcm4bsq@virginia.edu). I (foolishly) check my email constantly, so I will see it. You can also reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackson-miskill-291578213/), if you would like.
