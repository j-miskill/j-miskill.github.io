<p>Welcome to the weirdest thing you will probably ever read.</p>

<p>This is a journal of my life. Inspired by my grandma, I thought it would be a brilliant idea to document various aspects of my life in a more persistent manner than simply writing my thoughts down in a physical journal.</p>

<p>You see, I have actually been keeping a journal for quite some time now, but I have not been incredibly consistent about actually following through with the journal itself. So, I wanted to start this blog/journal in order to keep consistency and to allow my family member from across the country to read through some of the crazy things going on in my life.</p>

<p>What will be going on:
To be clear, I will not be writing about the incredibly intimate details of my life (like how I go to town on Taco Bell value menu burritos with my little brother), but rather include events I go to, thoughts I have, and things I am working on.</p>

<p>I will write a post once a week. The following things will be covered.</p>

<p>Computer Science and or Cognitive Science
An event going on/ that has already happened in my life
Thoughts that I have been having
Things I have been working on (both physical projects as well as mental/emotional aspirations).
I will include pictures and will write in a conversational-style.</p>

<p>This is the first time I am publishing something like this to the Internet. Furthermore, I am considering this website a long term project that will hopefully continue well into the future! As I figure out what I want to post and donâ€™t want to post, I expect this blog to evolve into what is essentially a virtual version of me.</p>

<p class="css/">Thank you for reading.</p>
