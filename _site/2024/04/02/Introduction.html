    <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>02 Apr 2024 - </p>

<h1 id="hi-im-jackson">Hi, I’m Jackson!</h1>

<p>I am a fourth year at the University of Virginia studying computer science for my undergraduate and graduate degrees. In Fall 2024 I will officially be a masters student going for my MCS degree.</p>

<h3 id="my-interests">My Interests</h3>
<p>I am interested in creating software for the public good; when I land a job, I want to use that job to promote the public welfare and create better lives for those around the world. I believe that technology can be the answer to that.</p>

<p>Recently, I have found data science, specifically within the realms of artificial intelligence and machine learning to be fascinating. I think that these tools can be used to create lots of good in the world. One movement that I am absolutely enamored with is <a href="https://ai4sibook.org/">AI For Social Good</a>. I will likely be writing about lots of these things very soon.</p>

<p>In addition to all the computer science, I am double majoring in cognitive science. I find the study of the brain to be intrinsically very interesting. Lately, I have been reading and thinking about problem-solving, focus, and flow.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-i-create-this-website">Why Did I Create This Website</h3>

<p>WordPress sucks for free writing. I am not a professional looking to make money by writing crap all the time. I am looking for a place to be creative an express myself.</p>

<h3 id="contact">Contact</h3>

<p>I can be reached at <a href="jcm4bsq@virginia.edu">jcm4bsq@virginia.edu</a>. You can also reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackson-miskill-291578213/">LinkedIn</a>, if you would like.</p>
